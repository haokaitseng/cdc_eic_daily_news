Taiwan’s international epidemic intelligence mechanism is designed for the real-time monitoring and public notification of global infectious disease threats of significant concern. We evaluate the mechanism’s performance from 2009 to 2025 using open data from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC), focusing on three thematic metrics: importance, timeliness, and information impact.

Based on 73,344 country-disease incidents in the International Epidemic News (IEN), the mechanism functioned as a responsive intelligence framework where surveillance priorities evolved in alignment with domestic and global trends. The most frequently monitored diseases - novel influenza A, COVID-19, dengue fever, poliomyelitis, and measles - closely mirrored the priorities featured in the World Health Organization (WHO) Disease Outbreak News. 

Reflecting a risk-based approach, surveillance was concentrated on Taiwan’s high-volume travel routes, such as the United States, China, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Negative binomial regression showed that during WHO-declared Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC) periods, IEN's weekly reporting frequency for the declared disease increased 9.28-fold (95% CI: 3.48-24.79) compared to pre-declaration levels.

Regarding timeliness, the IEN exhibited high operational stability, with an average annual median publication lag of only 3 days from original news sources. Reflecting high public engagement, the International Travel Health Notice became TCDC’s most-downloaded dataset on the Open Data portal, totaling 67,305 downloads. Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis using the Gemini 2.5 Flash model found that 34% of TCDC news releases leveraged international intelligence, underscoring its central role in risk communication.

In conclusion, the mechanism effectively fulfilled its mandate by operating with high precision, timeliness, and impact. To bolster national resilience against emerging and re-emerging health threats, future efforts should prioritize deeper AI integration to enhance early warning capabilities and continue optimizing risk communication.
